# Hi, I’m @ShrimpTacos314!

I am a teenage web developer-in-training who uses GitHub to store his CSS source code.

# What do I do?

## Code

I am finished learning basic HTML and CSS. After I create a test webpage with my skills, I am going to learn JavaScript. After some of that, I am looking into free-lance web development.

## Game

I like to play Nintendo games! I also play Minecraft and Minecraft Dungeons.

## Music

I am an audiophile in many ways. My specialty is currently Nintendo OSTs although I used to listen to EDM a lot. I also play the piano.

## Family

In the midst of a loving family with three brothers!

## Jesus

I am a proud Christian. My dad is a pastor at my church.
